# ⚠️ This Repository Has Moved

This project has been moved to the **Phoenix Pulse organization** monorepo and is no longer maintained here.

---

## 🔗 New Location

**🏠 Monorepo:** [github.com/phoenix-pulse/phoenix-ls](https://github.com/phoenix-pulse/phoenix-ls)

All development, releases, and support now happen in the new monorepo.

---

## 📦 What Changed?

Phoenix Pulse has evolved into a **multi-editor tooling suite** supporting:

- **VS Code Extension** - Full-featured extension with custom UI
- **Neovim Plugin** - Complete Neovim integration with custom UI
- **Language Server** - Shared LSP core (`@phoenix-pulse/language-server`)

To better support this architecture, the project moved to a **monorepo structure** under the Phoenix Pulse organization.
